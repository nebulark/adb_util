# Android Development Bridge Utility
This software provides a GUI to record and replay inputs on an attached device using the [Android Development Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) (ADB).
Make sure you have ADB installed and your connected device has [debugging enabled](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#Enabling), before starting this software.

This is a simple working prototype. It may crash, frezze or contain other bugs.
